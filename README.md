# Singapore-Resale-Flat-Prices-Predicting
## Project Overview
  The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. This predictive model will be based on historical data of resale flat transactions and aims to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.

## Skills Takeaway
* Data Wrangling
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Model Building
* Model Deployment
* Domain
* Real Estate

## Problem Statement
  The resale flat market in Singapore is highly competitive, and accurately estimating the resale value of a flat can be challenging due to numerous influencing factors like location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the resale prices of flats in Singapore and deploy this model as a web application to assist users in making informed decisions based on estimated resale prices.

## Motivation
  The project is motivated by the complexities and competitive nature of the resale flat market in Singapore. By developing a predictive model, we aim to provide an effective tool for both buyers and sellers to estimate the resale prices, thereby facilitating better decision-making in the housing market.

## Scope of the Project
The project involves the following tasks:
1.Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect a dataset of resale flat transactions from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) for the years 1990 to the present. Clean and structure the data for machine learning.
2.Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset such as town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date. Create additional features to enhance prediction accuracy.
3.Model Selection and Training: Choose an appropriate machine learning model for regression (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or random forests). Train the model on historical data, using a portion of the dataset for training.
4.Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's predictive performance using regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score.
5.Streamlit Web Application: Develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit that allows users to input details of a flat (town, flat type, storey range, etc.). Utilize the trained machine learning model to predict the resale price based on user inputs.
6.Deployment on Render: Deploy the Streamlit application on the Render platform to make it accessible to users over the internet.
7.Testing and Validation: Thoroughly test the deployed application to ensure it functions correctly and provides accurate predictions.

## Deliverables
* A well-trained machine learning model for resale price prediction.
* A user-friendly web application (built with Streamlit) deployed on the Render platform.
* Documentation and instructions for using the application.
* A project report summarizing the data analysis, model development, and deployment process.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is obtained from the Singapore Government's open data portal: data.gov.sg.

## Results
The project will benefit both potential buyers and sellers in the Singapore housing market. Buyers can use the application to estimate resale prices and make informed decisions, while sellers can get an idea of their flat's potential market value. Additionally, the project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in real estate and web development.
